# HUGO deployment for tfindley.co.uk

[![Deploy Hugo site to Pages](https://github.com/tfindley/tfindley.github.io/actions/workflows/hugo.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tfindley/tfindley.github.io/actions/workflows/hugo.yaml)

This is the HUGO deployment for my Personal Webpage, hosted in Github.io.

It is built using [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) and the [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page/) theme.

The site can be accessed at its real URL, [tfindley.co.uk](https://tfindley.co.uk), or at its GitHub IO link at [tfindley.github.io](https://tfindley.github.io).
