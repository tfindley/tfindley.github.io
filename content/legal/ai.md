# AI Use

## My Ethical statement

AI (such as ChatGPT, CoPilot) is occasionally used on creation of my website content and code.

I will ensure that the content contains a footer stating if it was used or not. Whever AI is used, I will do my best to explain how it was used and for what purposes. As AI is becoming far more mainstream, I feel it is important to be transparrent about how and where it is used.

### Website Content

When AI is utilised for written website content, it is always in a collaborative sense, for creating talking points, suggesting changes and correcting gramour, syntax and tone. I do not and will not use AI to genereate complete sections of content. Anything produced is always of my own opinion, with my own voice, and represents my views.

### Code

When AI is utilised for my code, I work with it in a collaborative sense to create samples of code that are not specific to the task at hand. I then adapt output from this to the task at hand. Whenever code is produced by AI, it is validated, checked, and understood prior to using in anything I produce.
