Where the magic happens

My IT Career has been built largely around a journey of self learning and self discovery. My experience in business continually feeds my homelab build, and my homelab continually feeds and grows the infrastructrure in the business I work in.

## Is a homelab important?

Technically, no. But it's fun to have one!

From experience managing teams of individuals with varying degrees of experience, those whom have grown fastest in their career paths have been those who have expressed interests in the technology and learning journey outside of work. Their technology journey becomes a passion which feeds their career.

If you are deciding whether or not to make a homelab, just remember; you are technically bringing your work home with you. Be sure that if you're going to build something that is running *critical* services for your home, that you have the ability to run and maintain those at production-like stability. Keep yoruself a seperate area or working methedology for those development services,
