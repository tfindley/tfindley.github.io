A starter page for my meshtastic hobby.

## What is Meshtastic?

An open source, off-grid, decentralized, mesh network built to run on affordable, low-power devices

## Meshtastic and me

I discovered Meshtastic in 2023 thanks to a colleague at SiXworks. I had the opportunity to play around with a couple of devices from Lilygo, and thought they were cool but didnt think too much of it.

One late evening in 2024 I was browsing the internet and came across the meshtastic subreddit. I immediately thought it looked cool and remembered trying it a year prior. So... why not... it's fairly cheap to get into, so its worth trying.
