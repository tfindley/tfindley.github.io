Where the magic happens

My IT Career has been built largely around a journey of self learning and self discovery. My experience in business continually feeds my homelab build, and my homelab continually feeds and grows the infrastructrure in the business I work in.

## Is a homelab important?

Technically, no. But it's fun to have one!

From experience working with and managing individuals in the industry with varying degrees of experience, I've noticed those whom have grown fastest in their chosen career paths have been those who have expressed interests in the technology and learning journey outside of work. Their technology journey becomes a passion which feeds their career. That's not to say that this is for everyone. It has to be recognised that not everyones life lends itself to extra-curicular working. I would only encourage it if you have the time, or the inclination to do it.

If you are deciding whether or not to make a homelab, just remember; you are technically bringing your work home with you. Be sure that if you're going to build something that is running *critical* services for your home, that you have the ability to run and maintain those at production-like stability. This is especially important if you're doing this for other people who rely on the services you build. In these instances, consider having a development area in which you can test changes before you make them live on the production service. An alternative would be a green/blue deployment method, or use a rapid service fallback method that you can recover to in case of failure.
