# My DevOps Manifesto

DevOps is more than a toolkit — it’s a mindset. It’s the commitment to build systems that are repeatable, resilient, observable, and secure, while never losing sight of the people who run and depend on them.

## Principles I work by

- **Automation first:** Manual work is waste. Automation should be reusable, sustainable, and documented so it can be understood and improved by anyone. My Ansible roles, Terraform modules, and CI/CD pipelines are designed for repeatability, resilience, and auditability.

- **Cattle, not pets:** Infrastructure should be disposable, redeployable, and recoverable. We don’t need to cling to broken systems — we replace them. The real value lies in data, code, and endpoints.

- **Observability as governance:** Monitoring isn’t an afterthought. Systems must be self-healing where possible, and failures should be visible, measurable, and traceable. Observability is a shared responsibility, not just a tool.

- **Security by design:** Compliance isn’t bureaucracy — it’s reliability. From ISO27001 practices to NIS2 readiness, strong policies like change management and MI frameworks allow rapid iteration with lower risk.

- **People at the core:** DevOps is a team sport. Tools and processes succeed only when teams are engaged, trained, and empowered. Coaching, mentoring, and setting a shared vision matter as much as YAML and pipelines.

- **Pragmatism over perfection:** Not everything needs automating. Sometimes speed trumps purity. The art of DevOps is knowing when to script, when to automate, and when to just get the job done.

## Why I do this

I’m motivated by the impact: seeing teams succeed because the friction has been removed, systems scale because the foundations are solid, and individuals grow because they feel supported and part of a shared vision. DevOps is not the destination — it’s the constant journey of improving how people and systems work together.
