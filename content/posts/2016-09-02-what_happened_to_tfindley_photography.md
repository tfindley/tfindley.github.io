Those of you who have kept up to date with me over the past few years know that I sunk a fair amount of time and effort into my online presence. SoÂ why was it that 3 months ago <a href="https://tfindley.co.uk">tfindley.co.uk</a> changed to a default WordPress holding page?

Anyone who had read articles I had written in the past will know that I don't write solely about photography. The issue was that my TFindley Photography website had become a dumping ground for all sorts of different articles, none of which seemed much to do with photography. It portrayed a confused image. With certain things in my life looking like they might change over the next year or two, I decided to pull down the existing website hosted at [tfindley.co.uk](https://tfindley.co.uk), along with 3 or 4 other WordPress websites I had been managing. The content was then divided up into different categories, and separate sites built to manage the different sorts of content. As such, TFindley Photography moved from [tfindley.co.uk](https://tfindley.co.uk) to [photo.tfindley.co.uk](https://photo.tfindley.co.uk), with the former currently functioning as a landing page for about 5 different websites.

I've only just started redeveloping TFindley Photography, and there is a long way to go until the site is restored to its former glory, but it is happening. Watch this space for more developments
