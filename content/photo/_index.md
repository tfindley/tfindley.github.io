In conjunction with my IT career I have taken it upon myself to developed a set of creative skills. While originally centered around Photography, my areas of experience have quickly diverged into Video Production, Desktop Publishing and Audio Engineering.

I originally began working as a Behind The Scenes (BTS) photographer in the North London film industry using skills I developed from photographing Wildlife. Working as a BTS photographer allowed me to branch out into the film industry, gathering valuable experience as a Runner, Boom Operator, Camera Operator, Assistant Director and Second Unit Director.

I also branched out into Wedding and Event photography, photographing numerous events from corporate to sports. Desktop Publishing came out of the requirement to advertise myself and my services, as well as to develop digital assets for use on websites. This got me into using Adobe Photoshop in conjunction with Adobe Illustrator and InDesign.

## TFindley Photography

Originally founded in 2010 as Alopex Productions, TFindley Photography has gone through various phases over the decade and a half since its foundation. Covering various aspects of photography from Wildlife to film-set photography, this Farnborough-based company can turn its lens to almost anything they set their sights on, providing excellent results every time with a personal and customer focused touch.

While our first photographic love (and our roots) will always be in Wildlife photography, we have a long distinguished portfolio of Film-Set Photography, Event Photography, Portraiture and Sports photography.
