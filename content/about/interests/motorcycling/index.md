I began my journey into the world of Motorcycling in January 2016 when I took my CBT. This was the first time I had ever ridden a motorcycle. One month after passing I purchased my first motorbike - a Yamaha YBR-125 2015. Over the next 4 months I rode 1295 miles, gaining valuable experience before I took the next step toward taking my full A-class license.

During those four months I chronicled my journey with the hope of passing on my knowledge and experience to others who wanted to venture into the world of Motorcycling. I published many posts online at https://myfirstmotorcycle.wordpress.com.

I now ride a Triumph Tiger 1200 XRx Low

Since then, I've moved my online biking exploits over to https://biker.tfindley.co.uk.
