I **LOVE** to ski! Whether its in the French Alps or the far-away land of Canada, give me a mountain with snow, two planks to strap to my feet, and I’m the happiest person in the world! My first time on snow was in 1994 when I skied in Arinsal, Andorra.  Since then, I’ve tried to escape to the mountains every year to get a fix of that fresh mountain air and that crisp snow.
