Iâ€™m Tristan Findley.

I'm an Automation / DevOps / Site Reliability Engineer and qualified Team Leader with a background in IT Systems Administrator. My [Professional Experience](experience) totals 19+ years in Public and Private sectors covering Defence, Cloud Infrastructure, Telecommunications, Research and Further Education.

My primary IAC (Infrastructure as Code) and Automation languages are Ansible and Terraform with a prior background in Chef. Combining these with CI/CD (Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment), CMDB (Configuration Management DataBase) integration and Runbook Automation to provide an end-to-end automation platform.

Combining my eight years of automation engineering with my ten years of systems administration experience allows me to bring an experienced approach to IAC, integrating it with a modern DevOps methodology of Code / Release / Develop.

In 2023 I completed a the People Leadership Programme with Multiverse, gaining a Distinction in People Leadership with the Chartered Management Institute. I have been a practicing manager since 2022 in the field of Automation and Service Reliability Engineering for two promenant UK companies in the Defence and Government sectors.

Since 2024 I have moved from the Farnborough, Hampshire, UK to Roeselsare, Belgium, and am now working in the European Biotechnology world at the Vlaams Institute of Biotechnology (Vlaams Instituut voor Biotechnologie).

I have also undertaken IT Contracts for End Users and Small businesses, focusing on managing and supporting bespoke IT solutions, Systems Administration and Support, and Web Hosting and Development. This allowed me to develop new IT skills and experience which I brought to my position.

Adding my skills as a [Creative Professional](creative) in the Photography and Video worlds lets me bridge the gap between the Technical and Creative, providing a full end-to-end solution which delivers not only on the platform but also on Digital Asset creation. During my work as a photorapher I worked in the Film Industry, collecting credits across various small productions (See [Filmography](filmography)), and even directing and filming an interview with Jeff Widener for Royal Holloway University.
