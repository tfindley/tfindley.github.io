In tandem with my technical career, I’ve nurtured a set of creative skills. While my initial focus was Photography, my experience has expanded into Video Production, Desktop Publishing, and Audio Engineering.

I began as a Behind-The-Scenes (BTS) photographer in North London’s film industry, drawing on skills developed through Wildlife photography. This led me to various roles within the film industry, including Runner, Boom Operator, Camera Operator, Assistant Director, and Second Unit Director. I also explored Wedding and Event photography, covering everything from corporate gatherings to sports events.

The need for self-promotion and digital assets prompted my delve into Desktop Publishing. This introduced me to tools like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign, enhancing my skill set further.
