**Automation Engineer (DevOps), Change Manager, Major Incident Coordinator**

06/03/2024 - Present

Serving as a DevOps-focused engineer within the Data Core division, responsible for designing, building, and maintaining critical infrastructure to support high-performance scientific research. My role combines platform engineering and site reliability responsibilities, with a particular emphasis on helping the organisation implement and align with NIS2 and ISO27001 standards through both system design and governance process development.

Since starting with Data Core in 2024, I have designed and implemented the following policies, procedures and working practices in accordance with NIS2 and ISO27001:

- Change Management
- Major Incident Management
- Solution Development

---

## Key Responsibilities

- Manage, maintain, and improve the existing infrastructure using expertise as an Automation Engineer and Site Reliability Engineer.
- Identify and automate manual processes to introduce input validation, error checking, logging, and reporting.
- Provision virtual infrastructure for internal and adjacent teams to support their daily functions.
- Enhance and maintain the Configuration Management Database (Netbox) as the authoritative source of truth.
- Act as a Subject Matter Expert, providing technical authority for code reviews and risk analysis to prioritize user experience, uptime, and reliability.
- Serve as Change Manager and Chair of the Change Advisory Board, championing and updating processes aligned with ITIL best practices.
- Function as Major Incident Coordinator during service outages, leading impact assessments and resolution efforts.
- Leverage ISO27001 and ITIL expertise to implement processes and procedures that meet emerging NIS2 requirements.
- Triage daily service issues and coach team members in Linux, automation, and IT best practices.
- Manage the onboarding of researchers to VIB Datacore by provisioning object storage and account services.
- Develop and maintain the VIB Datacore storage infrastructure, including designing and building a sensitive data storage and compute platform for Human Identifiable Data.

## Achievements

- Authored and implemented the Change Management Process, Procedure, and Policy.
- Authored and implemented the Major Incident Management Process, Procedure, and Policy.
- Designed and deployed the VIB Datacore SIEM Stack, integrating Wazuh, OpenSearch, Graylog, and MongoDB.
- Implemented a highly available HashiCorp Vault solution, configured to:
  - Act as an intermediary certificate authority with automated certificate issuing and renewal using Certbot.
  - Provide S3 storage encryption in conjunction with MinIO.
- Built a highly available Docker Swarm cluster with dedicated environments for development and customer testing.
- Developed service endpoint monitoring and alerting to support active incident response and feed into the Major Incident process.
- Automated virtual infrastructure deployment using Infrastructure as Code principles, reducing VM deployment to two commands:
  - <90 seconds for provisioning any number of virtual machines.
  - <5 minutes for fully configured, updated, and ready-to-use VMs.
